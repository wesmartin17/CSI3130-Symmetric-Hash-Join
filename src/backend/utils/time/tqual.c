 *
 * tqual.c
 *	  POSTGRES "time" qualification code, ie, tuple visibility rules.
 *
 * The caller must hold at least a shared buffer context lock on the buffer
 * containing the tuple.  (VACUUM FULL assumes it's sufficient to have
 * exclusive lock on the containing relation, instead.)
 *
 * NOTE: all the HeapTupleSatisfies routines will update the tuple's
 * "hint" status bits if we see that the inserting or deleting transaction
 * has now committed or aborted.
 *
 * NOTE: must check TransactionIdIsInProgress (which looks in PGPROC array)
 * before TransactionIdDidCommit/TransactionIdDidAbort (which look in
 * pg_clog).  Otherwise we have a race condition: we might decide that a
 * just-committed transaction crashed, because none of the tests succeed.
 * xact.c is careful to record commit/abort in pg_clog before it unsets
 * MyProc->xid in PGPROC array.  That fixes that problem, but it also
 * means there is a window where TransactionIdIsInProgress and
 * TransactionIdDidCommit will both return true.  If we check only
 * TransactionIdDidCommit, we could consider a tuple committed when a
 * later GetSnapshotData call will still think the originating transaction
 * is in progress, which leads to application-level inconsistency.	The
 * upshot is that we gotta check TransactionIdIsInProgress first in all
 * code paths, except for a few cases where we are looking at
 * subtransactions of our own main transaction and so there can't be any
 * race condition.
