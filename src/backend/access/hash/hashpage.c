 * NOTES
 *	  Postgres hash pages look like ordinary relation pages.  The opaque
 *	  data at high addresses includes information about the page including
 *	  whether a page is an overflow page or a true bucket, the bucket
 *	  number, and the block numbers of the preceding and following pages
 *	  in the same bucket.
 *
 *	  The first page in a hash relation, page zero, is special -- it stores
 *	  information describing the hash table; it is referred to as the
 *	  "meta page." Pages one and higher store the actual data.
 *
 *	  There are also bitmap pages, which are not manipulated here;
 *	  see hashovfl.c.
