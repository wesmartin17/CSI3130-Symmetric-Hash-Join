.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBvacuumdb\fR is a utility for cleaning a
PostgreSQL database.
\fBvacuumdb\fR will also generate internal statistics
used by the PostgreSQL query optimizer.
.PP
\fBvacuumdb\fR is a wrapper around the SQL
command VACUUM [\fBvacuum\fR(7)].
There is no effective difference between vacuuming databases via
this utility and via other methods for accessing the server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBvacuumdb\fR accepts the following command-line arguments:
.TP
\fB-a\fR
.TP
\fB--all\fR
Vacuum all databases.
.TP
\fB[-d] \fIdbname\fB\fR
.TP
\fB[--dbname] \fIdbname\fB\fR
Specifies the name of the database to be cleaned or analyzed.
If this is not specified and \fB-a\fR (or
\fB--all\fR) is not used, the database name is read
from the environment variable \fBPGDATABASE\fR. If
that is not set, the user name specified for the connection is
used.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
.TP
\fB--echo\fR
Echo the commands that \fBvacuumdb\fR generates
and sends to the server.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
.TP
\fB--full\fR
Perform ``full'' vacuuming.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
.TP
\fB--quiet\fR
Do not display a response.
.TP
\fB-t \fItable\fB [ (\fIcolumn\fB [,...]) ]\fR
.TP
\fB--table \fItable\fB [ (\fIcolumn\fB [,...]) ]\fR
Clean or analyze \fItable\fR only.
Column names may be specified only in conjunction with
the \fB--analyze\fR option.
.sp
.RS
.B "Tip:"
If you specify columns, you probably have to escape the parentheses
from the shell. (See examples below.)
.RE
.sp
.TP
\fB-v\fR
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR
Print detailed information during processing.
.TP
\fB-z\fR
.TP
\fB--analyze\fR
Calculate statistics for use by the optimizer.
.PP
.PP
\fBvacuumdb\fR also accepts 
the following command-line arguments for connection parameters:
.TP
\fB-h \fIhost\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--host \fIhost\fB\fR
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the 
server
is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used 
as the directory for the Unix domain socket.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--port \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file 
extension on which the server
is listening for connections.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--username \fIusername\fB\fR
User name to connect as
.TP
\fB-W\fR
.TP
\fB--password\fR
Force password prompt.
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGDATABASE\fR
.TP
\fBPGHOST\fR
.TP
\fBPGPORT\fR
.TP
\fBPGUSER\fR
Default connection parameters
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
In case of difficulty, see VACUUM [\fBvacuum\fR(7)] and \fBpsql\fR(1) for
discussions of potential problems and error messages.
The database server must be running at the
targeted host. Also, any default connection settings and environment
variables used by the \fBlibpq\fR front-end
library will apply.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
\fBvacuumdb\fR might need to connect several
times to the PostgreSQL server, asking
for a password each time. It is convenient to have a
\fI~/.pgpass\fR file in such cases. See the documentation for more information.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To clean the database test:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBvacuumdb test\fR
.sp
.fi
.PP
To clean and analyze for the optimizer a database named
bigdb:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBvacuumdb --analyze bigdb\fR
.sp
.fi
.PP
To clean a single table
foo in a database named
xyzzy, and analyze a single column
bar of the table for the optimizer:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBvacuumdb --analyze --verbose --table 'foo(bar)' xyzzy\fR
.sp
.fi
