.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR removes an existing
PostgreSQL user.
Only superusers and users with the CREATEROLE privilege can
remove PostgreSQL users. (To remove a
superuser, you must yourself be a superuser.)
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR is a wrapper around the
SQL command DROP ROLE [\fBdrop_role\fR(7)].
There is no effective difference between dropping users via
this utility and via other methods for accessing the server.

.TP

In case of difficulty, see DROP ROLE [\fBdrop_role\fR(7)] and \fBpsql\fR(1) for

variables used by the \fBlibpq\fR front-end
library will apply.
