.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdroplang\fR is a utility for removing an 
existing programming language from a
PostgreSQL database.
\fBdroplang\fR can drop any procedural language,
even those not supplied by the PostgreSQL distribution.
.PP
Although backend programming languages can be removed directly using
several SQL commands, it is recommended to use
\fBdroplang\fR because it performs a number
of checks and is much easier to use. See
DROP LANGUAGE [\fBdrop_language\fR(7)]
for more.
