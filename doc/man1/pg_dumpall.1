.SH NAME
pg_dumpall \- extract a PostgreSQL database cluster into a script file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBpg_dumpall\fR [ \fB\fIoption\fB\fR\fI...\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpg_dumpall\fR is a utility for writing out
(``dumping'') all PostgreSQL databases
of a cluster into one script file. The script file contains
SQL commands that can be used as input to \fBpsql\fR(1) to restore the databases. It does this by
calling \fBpg_dump\fR(1) for each database in a cluster.
\fBpg_dumpall\fR also dumps global objects
that are common to all databases.
(\fBpg_dump\fR does not save these objects.)
This currently includes information about database users and
groups, and access permissions that apply to databases as a whole.
.PP
Since \fBpg_dumpall\fR reads tables from all
databases you will most likely have to connect as a database
superuser in order to produce a complete dump. Also you will need
superuser privileges to execute the saved script in order to be
allowed to add users and groups, and to create databases.
.PP
The SQL script will be written to the standard output. Shell
operators should be used to redirect it into a file.
.PP
\fBpg_dumpall\fR needs to connect several
times to the PostgreSQL server (once per
database). If you use password authentication it is likely to ask for
a password each time. It is convenient to have a
\fI~/.pgpass\fR file in such cases. See the documentation for more information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following command-line options control the content and
format of the output.
.TP
\fB-a\fR
.TP
\fB--data-only\fR
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions).
.TP
\fB-c\fR
.TP
\fB--clean\fR
Include SQL commands to clean (drop) databases before
recreating them. \fBDROP\fR commands for roles and
tablespaces are added as well.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
.TP
\fB--inserts\fR
Dump data as \fBINSERT\fR commands (rather
than \fBCOPY\fR). This will make restoration very slow;
it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into
non-PostgreSQL databases. Note that
the restore may fail altogether if you have rearranged column order.
The \fB-D\fR option is safer, though even slower.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
.TP
\fB--column-inserts\fR
.TP
\fB--attribute-inserts\fR
Dump data as \fBINSERT\fR commands with explicit
column names (INSERT INTO
\fItable\fR
(\fIcolumn\fR, ...) VALUES
\&...). This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly
useful for making dumps that can be loaded into
non-PostgreSQL databases.
.TP
\fB-g\fR
.TP
\fB--globals-only\fR
Dump only global objects (users and groups), no databases.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
.TP
\fB--ignore-version\fR
Ignore version mismatch between
\fBpg_dumpall\fR and the database server.

\fBpg_dumpall\fR can handle databases
from previous releases of PostgreSQL, but very
old versions are not supported anymore (currently prior to
7.0). Use this option if you need to override the version
check (and if \fBpg_dumpall\fR then
fails, don't say you weren't warned).
.TP
\fB-o\fR
.TP
\fB--oids\fR
Dump object identifiers (OIDs) as part of the
data for every table. Use this option if your application references
the OID
columns in some way (e.g., in a foreign key constraint).
Otherwise, this option should not be used.
.TP
\fB-O\fR
.TP
\fB--no-owner\fR
Do not output commands to set
ownership of objects to match the original database.
By default, \fBpg_dumpall\fR issues
\fBALTER OWNER\fR or 
\fBSET SESSION AUTHORIZATION\fR
statements to set ownership of created schema elements.
These statements
will fail when the script is run unless it is started by a superuser
(or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script).
To make a script that can be restored by any user, but will give
that user ownership of all the objects, specify \fB-O\fR.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
.TP
\fB--schema-only\fR
Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data.
.TP
\fB-S \fIusername\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--superuser=\fIusername\fB\fR
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling triggers.
This is only relevant if \fB--disable-triggers\fR is used.
(Usually, it's better to leave this out, and instead start the
resulting script as superuser.)
.TP
\fB-v\fR
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR
Specifies verbose mode. This will cause
\fBpg_dumpall\fR to output start/stop
times to the dump file, and progress messages to standard error.
It will also enable verbose output in \fBpg_dump\fR.
.TP
\fB-x\fR
.TP
\fB--no-privileges\fR
.TP
\fB--no-acl\fR
Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke commands).
.TP
\fB-X disable-dollar-quoting\fR
.TP
\fB--disable-dollar-quoting\fR
This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function bodies,
and forces them to be quoted using SQL standard string syntax.
.TP
\fB-X disable-triggers\fR
.TP
\fB--disable-triggers\fR
This option is only relevant when creating a data-only dump.
It instructs \fBpg_dumpall\fR to include commands
to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while
the data is reloaded. Use this if you have referential
integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you
do not want to invoke during data reload.

Presently, the commands emitted for \fB--disable-triggers\fR
must be done as superuser. So, you should also specify
a superuser name with \fB-S\fR, or preferably be careful to
start the resulting script as a superuser.
.TP
\fB-X use-set-session-authorization\fR
.TP
\fB--use-set-session-authorization\fR
Output SQL-standard \fBSET SESSION AUTHORIZATION\fR commands
instead of \fBALTER OWNER\fR commands to determine object
ownership. This makes the dump more standards compatible, but
depending on the history of the objects in the dump, may not restore
properly.
.PP
.PP
The following command-line options control the database connection parameters.
.TP
\fB-h \fIhost\fB\fR
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the database
server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is
used as the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default
is taken from the \fBPGHOST\fR environment variable,
if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the \fBPGPORT\fR environment variable, if
set, or a compiled-in default.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR
Connect as the given user.
.TP
\fB-W\fR
Force a password prompt. This should happen automatically if
the server requires password authentication.
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGHOST\fR
.TP
\fBPGPORT\fR
.TP
\fBPGUSER\fR
Default connection parameters
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Since \fBpg_dumpall\fR calls
\fBpg_dump\fR internally, some diagnostic
messages will refer to \fBpg_dump\fR.
.PP
Once restored, it is wise to run \fBANALYZE\fR on each
database so the optimizer has useful statistics. You
can also run \fBvacuumdb -a -z\fR to analyze all
databases.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To dump all databases:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBpg_dumpall > db.out\fR
.sp
.fi
.PP
To reload this database use, for example:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBpsql -f db.out postgres\fR
.sp
.fi
(It is not important to which database you connect here since the
script file created by \fBpg_dumpall\fR will
contain the appropriate commands to create and connect to the saved
databases.)
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBpg_dump\fR(1). Check there for details on possible
error conditions. Also see supported environment variables
(the documentation).
