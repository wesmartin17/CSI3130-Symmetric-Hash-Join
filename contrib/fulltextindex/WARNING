WARNING
-------

This implementation of full text indexing is very slow and inefficient.  It is
STRONGLY recommended that you switch to using contrib/tsearch which offers these
features:

Advantages
----------
* Actively developed and improved
* Tight integration with OpenFTS (openfts.sourceforge.net)
* Orders of magnitude faster (eg. 300 times faster for two keyword search)
* No extra tables or multi-way joins required
* Select syntax allows easy 'and'ing, 'or'ing and 'not'ing of keywords
* Built-in stemmer with customisable dictionaries (ie. searching for 'jellies' will find 'jelly')
* Stop words automatically ignored
* Supports non-C locales

Disadvantages
-------------
* Only indexes full words - substring searches on words won't work.
	eg. Searching for 'burg' won't find 'burger'

Due to the deficiencies in this module, it is quite likely that it will be removed from the standard PostgreSQL distribution in the future.
