The PostgreSQL contrib tree
---------------------------

This subtree contains porting tools, analysis utilities, and plug-in
features that are not part of the core PostgreSQL system, mainly because
they address a limited audience or are too experimental to be part of
the main source tree.  This does not preclude their usefulness.

Each subdirectory contains a README file with information about the
module.  Most items can be built with `gmake all' and installed with
`gmake install' in the usual fashion, after you have run the `configure'
script in the top-level directory.  Some directories supply new
user-defined functions, operators, or types.  In these cases, after you have
installed the files you need to register the new entities in the database
system by running the commands in the supplied .sql file.  For example,

	$ psql -d dbname -f module.sql

See the PostgreSQL documentation for more information about this
procedure.
